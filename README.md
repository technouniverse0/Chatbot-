# Understanding Flask-Based RAG Chatbots

This document serves as a knowledge base for understanding how to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based chatbot** using **Flask**, **LangChain**, **MongoDB**, and **OpenAI/Hugging Face models**.

---

## 📌 What is Flask?
**Flask** is a lightweight **Python web framework** used for building web applications and APIs.

### 🔹 Key Features of Flask:
- Micro-framework (minimal but extensible)
- Built-in development server and debugger
- Supports templating for frontend rendering
- WSGI-compliant (works with production servers)

## 🤖 What is a RAG-Based Chatbot?
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** enhances large language models by **retrieving relevant documents** before generating a response. This improves accuracy and reduces hallucinations.

### 🔹 How It Works:
1. The user submits a query.
2. The system retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base.
3. The retrieved data is combined with the query.
4. A language model generates a response based on the enriched context.
5. The response is returned to the user.

## 🔗 What is LangChain?
**LangChain** is a framework designed for building applications that integrate **LLMs (Large Language Models) with external data sources**.

### 🔹 Why Use LangChain?
- Supports multiple LLM providers.
- Manages document retrieval for RAG workflows.
- Enables advanced prompt engineering and response chaining.

## 🔍 Database: MongoDB Atlas
**MongoDB Atlas** is a cloud-based NoSQL database used for storing chat history and retrieved documents in RAG-based systems.

---

## 🔑 OpenAI API Integration
The chatbot leverages **OpenAI's GPT models** for generating responses based on user queries.

## 🛠 Key Components of a Flask RAG Chatbot
1. **Flask API** – Handles user requests and responses.
2. **MongoDB Atlas** – Stores chat history and retrieved knowledge.
3. **LangChain RAG Pipeline** – Manages document retrieval and LLM interaction.
4. **LLM Integration** – Uses OpenAI/Hugging Face models for response generation.
5. **Frontend UI** – Provides an interface for user interaction.
